#Results:
#Based on looking at data including card "Stampeding Elk Herd", it seems
#like it's a better idea to play with 18 lands than to include this bad card in
#the deck. A good card like Courier's Briefcase breaks even with a 18 lands deck.
#Because green colour is known for being better with more lands than other colours,
#I checked black colour too with cards Baleful Eidolon (a bad card) and Gurmag
#Angler (a decent card). The results were similar, so playing with 18 lands
#seemed more beneficial than adding a bad card to the deck.
#I had some trouble finding decks with exactly 17 land cards because cards like
#Bala Ged Recovery are not part of the source csv because their name doesn't
#match exactly due to being a dual faced card. But I tried my best to fix the
#problem.
